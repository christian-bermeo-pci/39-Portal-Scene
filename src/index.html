      <p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This was my first 3D scene created in blender. Following three.js
        Journey course I created this model and baked the texture. the glb and
        baked texture were imported into Three.js. The fireflies and Portal are
        animated GLSL shaders..!!
